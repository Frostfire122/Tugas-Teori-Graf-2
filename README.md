### Prim's Algorithm

  Steps:
  
  1. Start with any vertex in the graph
  2. Mark the starting vertex as part of the spanning tree
  3. Look at all edges that connect a vertex inside the tree to a vertex outside the tree.
  4. Choose the edge with the *smallest* weight.
  5. Add the chosen edge and its outside vertex to the spanning tree.
  6. Repeat steps 3–5 until all vertices are included in the spanning tree.
  7. The edges selected during the process form the minimum spanning tree.
